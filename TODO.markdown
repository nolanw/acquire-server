More things to do
=================

  - Test on Windows and Linux.
  - See how low a Python version we can go (guess: 2.5).
  - A configuration file for setting frontend/backend addresses and NetAcquire address and port.
  - Set up setuptools.
  - Look into wrapping acquire-server up with py2exe and/or py2app.
  - Look into a browser frontend, possibly behind [Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org).
